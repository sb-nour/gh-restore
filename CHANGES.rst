Fix
~~~
- Fix missing INFO logs. [Gallo Feliz]
- Always clone with OAuth token when provided. [Samantha Baldwin]

  Github Enterprise servers with 'Anonymous Git read access' disabled
  cause `git ls-remote` to fail (128) for a repo's `clone_url`. Using the
  OAuth token when provided allows cloning private AND public repos when
  Anonymous Git read access is disabled.
- Use distutils.core on error. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
- Use twine for releases. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  The old method of releasing to pypi broke for whatever reason and switching to a supported toolchain is easier than debugging the old one.

  Additionally:

  - Update gitchangelog
  - Fix license entry
  - Set long description type
  - Gitignore the temporary readme file
- Warn instead of error. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Refs #106
- Cleanup pep8 violations. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
- Properly import version from github_backup package. [Jose Diaz-
  Gonzalez]
- Support alternate git status output. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  version. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Fixed script fails if not installed from pip
- Fixed script fails if not installed from pip. [Ben Baron]

  At the top of the script, the line from github_backup import __version__ gets the script's version number to use if the script is called with the -v or --version flags. The problem is that if the script hasn't been installed via pip (for example I cloned the repo directly to my backup server), the script will fail due to an import exception.

  Also presumably it will always use the version number from pip even if running a modified version from git or a fork or something, though this does not fix that as I have no idea how to check if it's running the pip installed version or not. But at least the script will now work fine if cloned from git or just copied to another machine.

  broken-python3. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Fixed macOS keychain access when using Python 3
- Fixed macOS keychain access when using Python 3. [Ben Baron]

  Python 3 is returning bytes rather than a string, so the string concatenation to create the auth variable was throwing an exception which the script was interpreting to mean it couldn't find the password. Adding a conversion to string first fixed the issue.
- Merge pull request #137 from einsteinx2/issue/134-only-use-auth-token-
  when-needed. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Public repos no longer include the auth token
- Public repos no longer include the auth token. [Ben Baron]

  When backing up repositories using an auth token and https, the GitHub personal auth token is leaked in each backed up repository. It is included in the URL of each repository's git remote url.

  This is not needed as they are public and can be accessed without the token and can cause issues in the future if the token is ever changed, so I think it makes more sense not to have the token stored in each repo backup. I think the token should only be "leaked" like this out of necessity, e.g. it's a private repository and the --prefer-ssh option was not chosen so https with auth token was required to perform the clone.
- Merge pull request #130 from einsteinx2/issue/129-fix-crash-on-
  release-asset-download-error. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Crash when an release asset doesn't exist
- Fixed comment typo. [Ben Baron]
- Switched log_info to log_warning in download_file. [Ben Baron]
- Crash when an release asset doesn't exist. [Ben Baron]

  Currently, the script crashes whenever a release asset is unable to download (for example a 404 response). This change instead logs the failure and allows the script to continue. No retry logic is enabled, but at least it prevents the crash and allows the backup to complete. Retry logic can be implemented later if wanted.

- Merge pull request #132 from einsteinx2/issue/126-prevent-overwriting-
  release-assets. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Separate release assets and skip re-downloading
- Moved asset downloading loop inside the if block. [Ben Baron]
- Separate release assets and skip re-downloading. [Ben Baron]

  Currently the script puts all release assets into the same folder called `releases`. So any time 2 release files have the same name, only the last one downloaded is actually saved. A particularly bad example of this is MacDownApp/macdown where all of their releases are named `MacDown.app.zip`. So even though they have 36 releases and all 36 are downloaded, only the last one is actually saved.

  With this change, each releases' assets are now stored in a fubfolder inside `releases` named after the release name. There could still be edge cases if two releases have the same name, but this is still much safer tha the previous behavior.

  This change also now checks if the asset file already exists on disk and skips downloading it. This drastically speeds up addiotnal syncs as it no longer downloads every single release every single time. It will now only download new releases which I believe is the expected behavior.

  Fixes #29
- Fixes #29. [Jonas Michel]

  Reporting an error when the user's rate limit is exceeded causes
  the script to terminate after resuming execution from a rate limit
  sleep. Instead of generating an explicit error we just want to
  inform the user that the script is going to sleep until their rate
  limit count resets.
- Fixes #29. [Jonas Michel]

  The errors list was not being cleared out after resuming a backup
  from a rate limit sleep. When the backup was resumed, the non-empty
  errors list caused the backup to quit after the next `retrieve_data`
  request.

  Implement incremental updates
- Implement incremental updates. [Robert Bradshaw]

  Guarded with an --incremental flag.

  Stores the time of the last update and only downloads issue and
  pull request data since this time.  All other data is relatively
  small (likely fetched with a single request) and so is simply
  re-populated from scratch as before.
- Release version 0.9.0. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Don't store issues which are actually pull requests
- Don't store issues which are actually pull requests. [Enrico Tröger]

  This prevents storing pull requests twice since the Github API returns
  pull requests also as issues. Those issues will be skipped but only if
  retrieving pull requests is requested as well.
  Closes #23.

  Add backup hooks
- Improve error handling in case of HTTP errors. [Enrico Tröger]

  In case of a HTTP status code 404, the returned 'r' was never assigned.
  In case of URL errors which are not timeouts, we probably should bail
  out.
- Add --hooks to also include web hooks into the backup. [Enrico Tröger]
- Merge pull request #22 from eht16/issue_17_create_output_directory.
  [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Create the user specified output directory if it does not exist

  [Enrico Tröger]

  Fixes #17.

  Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Add missing auth argument to _get_response()
- Add missing auth argument to _get_response() [Enrico Tröger]

  When running unauthenticated and Github starts rate-limiting the client,
  github-backup crashes because the used auth variable in _get_response()
  was not available. This change should fix it.
- Merge pull request #20 from
  eht16/improve_error_msg_on_non_existing_repo. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Add repository URL to error message for non-existing repositories
- Add repository URL to error message for non-existing repositories.
  [Enrico Tröger]

  This makes it easier for the user to identify which repository does not
  exist or is not initialised, i.e. whether it is the main repository or
  the wiki repository and which clone URL was used to check.

- Merge pull request #9 from acdha/ratelimit-retries. [Jose Diaz-

  Retry API requests which failed due to rate-limiting
- Retry API requests which failed due to rate-limiting. [Chris Adams]

  This allows operation to continue, albeit at a slower pace,
  if you have enough data to trigger the API rate limits
- Release 0.4.0. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
- Merge pull request #7 from acdha/repo-backup-overhaul. [Jose Diaz-
  Gonzalez]

  Repo backup overhaul
- Update repository back up handling for wikis. [Chris Adams]

  * Now wikis will follow the same logic as the main repo
    checkout for --prefer-ssh.
  * The regular repository and wiki paths both use the same
    function to handle either cloning or updating a local copy
    of the remote repo
  * All git updates will now use “git fetch --all --tags”
    to ensure that tags and branches other than master will
    also be backed up
- Logging_subprocess: always log when a command fails. [Chris Adams]

  Previously git clones could fail without any indication
  unless you edited the source to change `logger=None` to use
  a configured logger.

  Now a non-zero return code will always output a message to
  stderr and will display the executed command so it can be
  rerun for troubleshooting.
- Switch to using ssh_url. [Chris Adams]

  The previous commit used the wrong URL for a private repo. This was
  masked by the lack of error loging in logging_subprocess (which will be
  in a separate branch)
- Merge pull request #6 from acdha/allow-clone-over-ssh. [Jose Diaz-
  Gonzalez]

  Add an option to prefer checkouts over SSH
- Add an option to prefer checkouts over SSH. [Chris Adams]

  for credentials for every repository
- Release 0.3.0. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
- Merge pull request #4 from klaude/pull_request_support. [Jose Diaz-
  Gonzalez]

  Add pull request support
- Add pull request support. [Kevin Laude]

  Back up reporitory pull requests by passing the --include-pulls
  argument. Pull requests are saved to
  repositories/<repository name>/pulls/<pull request number>.json. Include
  the --pull-request-comments argument to add review comments to the pull
  request backup and pass the --pull-request-commits argument to add
  commits to the pull request backup.

  Pull requests are automatically backed up when the --all argument is
  uesd.
- Merge pull request #5 from klaude/github-enterprise-support. [Jose
  Diaz-Gonzalez]
